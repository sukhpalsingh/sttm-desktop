 * You might want to sit down for this one, but the latest database update brought the number of corrections done by the BaniDB project up over 5,000! With Guru's Grace, SikhiToTheMax is using the most accurate digital Gurbani source available today.

### 3.2.0 - _170526_
#### Improved
 * Faster updates - We've reduced the size of the app and subsequent updates by storing the database separately on your device.
